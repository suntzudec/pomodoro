This is a React plugin (built in **2018** with ES6) for the freeCodeCamp Test Suite.  
[**Here is the DEMO**](https://usheninte.github.io/react-fcctest/)

## How To Use

* Run `npm i react-fcctest` or `yarn add react-fcctest` to install the React plugin

* Place `import ReactFCCtest from 'react-fcctest';` at the top of your **App.js** file

## Example

```javascript
  import React, { Component } from 'react';
  import ReactFCCtest from 'react-fcctest';

  class App extends Component {
    render() {
      return (
        <div>
          <ReactFCCtest />
        </div>
      );
    }
  };
  export default App;

```

That is all there is to it!
